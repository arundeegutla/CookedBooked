## Overview
### Description
Provide a platform for avid chefs and/or food enthusiasts to share their beloved recipe and connect with likeminded peers

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Food and Drink 🍽️
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn’t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features. 📱
- **Story:** Provides a feed of recipes based on the user interests and user can follow the creator, like, comment, share the recipe.
- **Market:** Any individual who wants to share or view recipes. 👨‍🍳
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their cooking skills are, and what exactly they’re looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with user sharing their recipes. Large potential for use with crowd-sourced review applications such as Yelp.
